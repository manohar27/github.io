But if you look at your docker image sizes, it might be huge. It was in my case at work, and it kind of defeated the purpose of using containers.</p>\n<p>Here’s something you can do quickly to drop some serious bytes from your Docker Image size. </p>\n<p>Change your Dockerfile from something like this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"docker\"><pre class=\"language-docker\"><code class=\"language-docker\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>8.16\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm install\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm run build <span class=\"token comment\">#lets say this generates your build bundles (dist folder)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">CMD</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"npm\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"run\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"start\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>To something like this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"docker\"><pre class=\"language-docker\"><code class=\"language-docker\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>8.16 as builder\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm install\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm run build\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>8.16 as production\n<span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>from=builder /dist ./\n<span class=\"token comment\">#COPY more stuff from builder like your ./server/node_modules and ./server/ whatever you need from your builder image</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">CMD</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"npm\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"run\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"start\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Okay so here’s what you did with this “multi-stage” build.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You created an intermediate image (<strong>builder)</strong></li>\n<li>You use the <strong>builder</strong> to install stuff you need ( this could even include a lot of stuff you don’t need in production like acceptance testing tools etc)</li>\n<li>But when you want the <strong>production</strong> image, you pick and choose what parts of <strong>builder</strong> you need, for e.g here I’m just copying the dist folder.</li>\n<li><strong>production</strong> image starts FROM node:8.16, it just adds one more layer on top to copy the dist folder</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But how did this help? Every docker instruction adds a bunch of size to your image. Every RUN, ADD, COPY adds to your image size. If you have fewer instructions, then you can reduce your image size. Using multi-stage build is a clean way to achieve fewer instructions.</p>\n<p>You can go through <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/\">this link</a> to find some cool best practice tips to write Dockerfiles.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to leverage multi-stage docker build to trim down the image size?","date":"September 23, 2019","description":"Use multi-stage builds to trim down your docker image size, here I explain with a node application"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/docker-multi-stage/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/heptagram-svg/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to make a Heptagram with SVG ?"}}}}}
