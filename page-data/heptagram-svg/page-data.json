Keeping the internal angle of 77.143deg between them. This turned out very tricky as &#x3C;Line/> and &#x3C;Path/> didn’t work based on angles or radians. So I looked at how to draw it on paper.</p>\n<h2>So how do you draw one on paper?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get the seven vertices of a regular heptagon</li>\n<li>Join alternate vertices</li>\n<li>And that’s it you have a 7/2 heptagram</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Let’s do it with SVG now, using the same approach</h2>\n<h3>Finding the 7 vertices</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First draw a &#x3C;Circle /></li>\n<li>Divide the circle into 7 pieces ( 360 deg divided by 7 = 51.4deg)</li>\n<li>Take the sine and cosine of incrementing angles(0, 51.4deg, 51.4deg * 2, 51.4deg * 3…)  to find the x,y co-ordinates on the circle</li>\n<li>That’s it, getting these vertices solves most of our problems</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Joining alternate vertices</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Now that we have the vertices (x,y co-ordinates), we’ve to join them</li>\n<li>All we do now is take alternate vertices and draw a &#x3C;Line /> between them</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Then add some animation jazz and you have a cool heptagram in SVG</h3>\n<p>TLDR; Here’s the codepen link\n<a href=\"https://codepen.io/mbmanohars/pen/vYBoxVY\">https://codepen.io/mbmanohars/pen/vYBoxVY</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to make a Heptagram with SVG ?","date":"October 02, 2019","description":"Cool SVG heptagram based on Tool's new album Fear Inoculum"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/heptagram-svg/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docker-multi-stage/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to leverage multi-stage docker build to trim down the image size?"}},"next":null}}}
